        "Ans:- The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression (SLR) ensure that the model produces reliable and unbiased results. These assumptions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Linearity\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y).\n",

        "No correlation between consecutive errors.\n",

        "Important especially for time-series data.\n",

        "\n",
        "The residuals have constant variance across all levels of X.\n",
        "\n",
        "Errors should be spread evenly around the regression line.\n",
        "\n",
